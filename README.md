# Cosmere Explorer
Let's explore the Cosmere!

## Whats the Cosmere?
The Cosmere is the name for the shared fictional universe of many of Bradon Sanderson's books. This interconnected cosmology describes many fantastical worlds that include planets, star systems, and other astrological bodies.

## What's this for?
This is a project that was started as part of the [2025 #ShardsOfSummer challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCbBsg0Kj3I). Specifically, the week 8 challenge was : "Create something that someone else in the community can interact with!".

I immediately latched onto an idea another Cosmere fan had mentioned to me several months previous (thanks plantlassie!) for a 3D solar-system type explorer. So thats what you see here!

## How do I use this?
To run the application, all you need to do is visit the Github pages website here : https://omnicrola.github.io/cosmere-explorer/

## FAQ
### Some of the planets don't have information
Not every single planet and asteroid in the Cosmere has been described in Brandon's books (yet?). So rather than make up information, I have left a '??' in places where information is unknown.

### I found a mistake!
Great! I welcome corrections if you find them. You are welcome to either make a pull request to this repository, or contact me directly on my Discord server here : https://discord.com/invite/nyJrmXcWAU

## TODO
There's a lot of features I'd still like to add, here's whats on the current roadmap:

* Planet icons
* Improved planetary shaders
* Multiple star systems
* Basic UI sounds
* Interstellar map
* Better background stars
* Hidden lore
* Gamified exploration badges
