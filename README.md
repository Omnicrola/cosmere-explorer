# Cosmere Explorer
Let's explore the Cosmere!

 -- Under Construction --

The Cosmere is the name for the shared fictional universe of many of Bradon Sanderson's books. This interconnected cosmology describes many planets, star systems, and other astrological bodies. This repository contains code to allow fans of the Cosmere to browse through a stellar system (just Roshar for now) and learn a little about each planet.
